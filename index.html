        <h4>Only Peter Tork and Micky Dolenz appear in every episode of the TV show.</h4>
        <p>Don't worry, the other two had good excuses. Davy Jones had to be written out of an episode so he
            could attend his sister's wedding. Michael Nesmith missed three shoots due to a tonsillectomy, the birth of his son Jonathan and a family trip to Texas.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4 text-center">
        <h4>Davy Jones was almost drafted by the Army.</h4>
        <p>In 1967, Jones was classified 1A by the draft board and up for service. Which seems odd, seeing how he 
            was a native of England. However, as an article from a July 1967 issue of Teen Life magazine told it, "When Davy 
            applied for an immigration visa to America, he had to sign a form stating that he knew that after six months here, 
            he would be eligible for the draft." Jones, having just wrapped the first season of The Monkees, fasted so he would become frail and fail the physical.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4 text-center">
        <h4>Paul Williams and Stephen Stills auditioned to be Monkees.</h4>
        <p>More than 400 young actors and musicians auditioned for the four roles. Stephen Stills and Paul Williams were among those who did not make the cut, 
            as were Danny Hutton (of Three Dog Night) and Harry Nilsson. The original idea was to cast an existing act, specifically the Lovin' Spoonful. Both Stills 
            and Spoonful frontman John Sebastian bristled at the idea of turning over their song publishing rights to the studio. Contrary to urban legend, Charles Manson did not audition.</p>
